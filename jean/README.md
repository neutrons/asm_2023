Ideas for talks

* using HFIR CT data as an example, I will show a simple notebooks with no widgets and how the developer needs to modify the content of the cells 
in order to analyze the data. And then another notebook with some simple widgets and how it boost the analysis process. The goal of this first 2
notebooks will be to show the interest of using widgets and how easy it is - Hands on possible at that stage
- link to web page listing the wigets available 
- maybe show topaz notebook with only widgets (used to create a config file)

* using SNS data, show a more complex analysis of data using widgets + PyQt interface - no Hands on here

* show examples of what can be done when combining notebooks and PyQt using analysis.sns.gov and jupyter notebooks
    - good example of notebooks could be: 
          * profile
          * registration
          * panoramic stiching
          * 

**library needed in the conda environment:**
