# Requirements

## computing knowledge

The lectures from this github repository will not provide any tutorials to the python language itself, so a minimum knowledge of python is strongly recommended. We will suppose that you are familiar with the basic of python and know how to install a library (via *pip* or *conda*). We also recommend you to use a different [conda environment](https://conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html)  than the native one available on your system. 

for example

> conda create -n python_asm_2023 python=3.10 numpy matplotlib jupyter

will create a python environment called `python_asm_2023` and automatically install python version 3.10, numpy, matplotlib and jupyter librairies.

## Software

Some of the lectures will have some hands-on exercises that you may choose to follow along or not. If you do, we recommend you to have **anaconda** 
installed on your machine. This is the easiest and quickest way to get python up and running on any operating system. To install **anaconda**, please refer to the [anaconda.com](https://www.anaconda.com/download) web site.
